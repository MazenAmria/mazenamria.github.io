A student in the M.Sc. programme in Computer Science at the University of Freiburg (Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg). Interested in Deep Learning, particularly, Optimization and the Dynamics of Learning Algorithms.

Worked as Software Engineer (Backend Web Development) for 3 years, and worked as Teaching Assistant for 1 year.

I like to work on projects that are _useless_ but fun. I have some _very tiny_ projects on my GitHub account, like [this](https://github.com/MazenAmria/torch) one, [that](https://github.com/MazenAmria/dithering) one, and few university projects.
